        <h1>A Short Biography on Nicholas Wadley</h1>
        <p>Nicholas Wadley is a senior at the University of Kentucky studying Information Communication Technology with a minor in Communications. Also, he just completed his certificate in Sports Communication, Media, and Promotion. Hailing all the way from Kennesaw, Georgia, Nicholas decided to come to UK so he could pursue education outside of his home state. This has been very beneficial, as he has grown substantially over the past four years. After graduation, he plans on getting a job in the Information Technology field while also pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science or Analytics. </p>
