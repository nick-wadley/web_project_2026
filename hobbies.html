            <h2>What Got Nicholas Into the Music and the Gym</h2>
        </header>
        <p>There are factors that got Nick into the Music and the Gym. First of all, growing up, his sister listened to music with him almost everyday. The main form of that was via the "Just Dance" series, in which the siblings performed choregraphed dance moves that aligned with a popular song. Nicholas's friends also listened to music in Middle and High School. As far as the gym goes, he was required to take a weight training class in his senior year of high school for the basketball program. Ever since then, he has been dedicated to maintaining his cardiovascular health by going to the gym.</p>
