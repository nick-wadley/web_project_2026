                <h2>Why Nicholas Fell In Love With Sports</h2>
            </header>
            <p>There are multiple reasons for Nicholas falling in love with sports. First off, his mother was a walk-on basketball player during her time at William & Mary University, something that inspired him to pick up basketball. To continue along that point, his mom, along with his father, have both been sports fans since they were around Nick's current age. Furthermore, being from Metro Atlanta, Nicholas has grown up watching Atlanta Falcons and Hawks games. Therefore, it was seemingly destiny that he would fall in love with sports due to his early exposure.</p>
